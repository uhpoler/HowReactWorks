# HowReactWorks

The **HowReactWorks** application is an interactive React-based tool designed to illustrate the fundamental concepts of React, including state and props management. Users can explore different topics through tabs, dynamically revealing summaries and details while engaging with the interface.

## Features

- **Tabbed Interface**: Navigate through different topics using an intuitive tabbed layout.
- **Dynamic Content**: Clickable tabs display summaries and detailed explanations of React concepts.
- **State Management**: Interactive elements demonstrate state changes and user interactions.
- **Like Counter**: Users can like the content, with options for single or triple increments.
- **Undo Functionality**: Allows users to reset likes and toggle visibility of details.

## Components

The project is structured with the following React components:

- **App**: The main component that renders the tabbed interface.
- **Tabbed**: Manages the active tab and displays corresponding content.
- **Tab**: Represents individual tabs for navigation.
- **TabContent**: Shows the summary and details of the selected tab, along with interactive buttons.
- **DifferentContent**: Displays a different message when navigating beyond the initial tabs.

## How It Works

1. The application starts with three main topics related to React, each displaying a summary.
2. Users can switch between tabs to reveal more detailed information about each topic.
3. The like counter allows users to express their appreciation for the content, with options to increment likes individually or by three.
4. An undo feature is available to reset likes and toggle the visibility of details.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **CSS**: For styling components and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language for implementing application logic.
